Genetic algorithm for solving the travelling salesman problem

We have some networks. Our goal is to visit every node in the network
using the
shortest path possible. We will be using large networks where the
search space
for the best path is too large to try every possible route. To find an
optimal
route, we will be using a genetic algorithm.

Process
-------

1.      Randomly generate a list of routes. These routes are simply generated by shuffling the list of nodes.

2.      Run a fitness test on each route that finds the length of the route.

3.	With the results from step two combine and splice the routes together to create a more favored route.

4.	Go back to step two and run until the optimal route is found.

Open questions:
---------------

*	How should we combine routes? Do we use the top 10%? 1%? Do we splice these
	routes together at random? Do we swap individual cities?
	
*	How should we implement the parallel portion? GPU? Threads? MPI?

To do:
------

*	Impliment a randomly generated system to give weights to routes.

Our data is the roadNet-TX.txt dataset from snap.stanford.edu
