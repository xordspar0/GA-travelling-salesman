Genetic algorithm for solving the travelling salesman problem

We have some networks. Our goal is to visit every node in the network using the
shortest path possible. We will be using large networks where the search space
for the best path is too large to try every possible route. To find an optimal
route, we will be using a genetic algorithm.

Our data is the roadNet-TX.txt dataset from snap.stanford.edu .

Algorithm
---------

1.	Randomly generate a list of routes. These routes are simply generated by
	shuffling the list of nodes.

2.	Run a fitness test on each route that finds the length of the route.

3.	With the results from step two combine and splice the routes together to
	create a more favored route.

4.	Go back to step two and run until the optimal route is found.

Compiling
---------

1.	To download the dataset, run:
	
	```
	./downloadDataset.sh
	```

2.	Next, prepare a subset of the full dataset:

	```
	Rscript subgraph.r
	```
	
3.	Finally, to compile the genetic algorithm, simply run:

	```
	make
	```

Running
-------

To run the serial version of the algorithm, use

```
./ga-serial dataset_filename
```

To run the parallel version, use

```
./ga-parallel dataset_filename
```

The number of threads to use for the parallel version can be changed by modifying the `NUMTHREADS` variable in `src/config.h`. After modifying this variable, recompile by typing `make`.
